# Unity Troubleshooting Guide

## ⚠️ Administrator Privileges Warning

**Issue**: "Unity is running with Administrator privileges, which is not supported"

**Solution**: 
1. Close Unity
2. Right-click Unity Hub → "Run as administrator" → **UNCHECK** this option
3. Or run Unity normally without administrator privileges
4. Reopen the project

**Why**: Unity doesn't need administrator privileges for normal development. Running as admin can cause security issues and project corruption.
